# Contributing
**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have questions, please ask it in [The Official Discord](https://discord.gg/eMz8HhA) instead of opening an issue -- you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to language files, please switch to the [Content repository](https://github.com/Millenaire/Content). If you want to contribute to the codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request (you'll be mostly asked to do that if you submit an issue).
